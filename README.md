# Python Content Management System CcMS

## Story

Bad news... Canvas is going down :(

Last Friday's afternoon Jerzy came to us and said:

Instracture Inc. has gone bankrupt. They're shutting down Canvas LMS next Saturday. You've got to do something!

Our reaction was simple:

Let's create our own Learning Management System. We'll call it Codecool Management System (CcMS).
